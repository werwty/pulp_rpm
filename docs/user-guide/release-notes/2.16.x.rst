Pulp 2.16 Release Notes
=======================

Pulp 2.16.0
===========

New Features
------------

* A new pulp-manifest tool that can be used to create PULP_MANIFEST for a
  directory that the user plans to use the iso importer with.

* Add support for SUSE Errata format. This includes the addition of two new
  fields on the Erratum mode: `relogin_suggested` and `restart_suggested`.
  Errata update logic has been modified so that if two Errata has the same `updated`
  timestamp we also check to see if the `version` field has been updated.
